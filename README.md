# Repository for Data Collection form

Heroku App here: https://dcniser.herokuapp.com/collect/

## Usage:

### Dependencies:
(Check `requirements.txt` for exact versions)

Python Packages:
* `django`
* `psycopg2`
* `Pillow`
* `dj-database-url`
* `gunicorn`
* `whitenoise`

System Dependencies:
* `postgresql` (Tested with `postgresql 12`)

### Setup:

* Create a working folder/directory somewhere and a python virtual enviroment in it. Activate the virtual environment.
* Install the dependencies, via `pip -r requirements.txt`. Install `postgresql` separately.
* Create a database in postgres. Easiest way is to use `pgAdmin` web interface. Make sure to remember the database name, database owner/user name and the password, you supplied, while setting up postgres.
* `git clone` this repo to the working directory.
* ~~Modify `local_settings_example.py` in `data_collection` with your data and rename the file to `local_settings.py`~~ This is no longer required. Make changes directly to the `settings.py` file. Fill the DB name, DB user name and DB password, in the `DATABASES` setting. Leave `Debug = True`, while testing the app.
* `cd` to working directory and run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`.
* Start the server using `python manage.py runserver localhost:8787`. (You can change the port, but change it everywhere ‚¨á)
* Browse to `localhost:8787` in your browser.
* To open the admin site, browse to `localhost:8787/admin`

### How does this work?

After setting up, first thing, you need to do, is to [create an admin/superuser](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial02/#creating-an-admin-user), go to the admin site and add an (or a few) `Applicant`(s). All you need to supply is an Application Number (Put a random number for now). `default_image` is set as the image for `photo` and `sign` fields, *by default*. Return to the main site and input the application number, for the `Applicant`, you just created, in the Application Number field. This is important, as the app checks for existing application numbers. You'll get an error, if the inputted application number does not exist in database. Next, input a name and upload a picture (try using the camera, if on a portable device). Use the signature pad to input the signature (try using a stylus, if on a touchscreen). All fields are required. After a successful submission, you will be shown a "Data submitted successfully" message. Go to the admin site. There, in Applicants, you should see the newly uploaded name, photograph and signature, under the corresponding application number.

#### Notes:
* Only the Application Numbers need to be preloaded into the database. A python utility to read a csv or excel sheet into the database will be added soon.
* The max length of the application number is currently set to 10, while Applicant Name length is capped at 100 characters.
* The photograph is supposed to be taken through the device camera, on the spot.
* The admin panel shows the application numbers, names, photos and signs for all applicants.
* Photo and Sign are set to `read_only` in the admin panel. As such, only application numbers and names can be modified from there. The data collection process will have to be redone for changing Photo and Sign. This is not a framework restriction. It's been designed this way.

## Issues

| Issues | Status | Notes |
|:---|---:|----|
| Required fields in form | ‚úÖ |
| `app_no` exists error | ‚úÖ |
| No images displayed in `/admin` | ‚úÖ |
| `get_` fields have to be set to `read_only` for images to display | ‚ùå |
| Clicking on Clear POSTs form | ‚úÖ | Fixed with `type="button"` in `<canvas>`
| "The 'sign' attribute has no file associated with it." | ‚úÖ | Have to `save()` directly to `sign` ImageField
| When submitting form, with signature_pad empty => `Form invalid!<ul class="errorlist"><li>raw_sign<ul class="errorlist"><li>This field is required.</li></ul></li></ul>` | ‚úÖ | Used custom validation, if `signature_pad.isEmpty()` |
| When another submission is made for the same `app_no`, the image file for `sign` has gibberish in its name. | ‚öô | **Happens alternately** |
